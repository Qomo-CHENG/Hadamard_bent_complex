# Self-Dual Bent Sequences for Complex Hadamard Matrices

This repo is created for investigating self-dual bent sequences in Complex Hadamard matrices. It is the open-source of the paper `Self-Dual Bent Sequences for Complex Hadamard Matrices`.

## Complex Hadamard matrices at different orders

***Note 1: SD for self-dual; seqs for sequences; Refs for references**
